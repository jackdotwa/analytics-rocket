## SEA-team

### Founding Document

#### 20190421

### 1. Overview

This document discusses what this team will concern itself with, why, and to what end.

### 2. Guiding Principles
 1. To explore the fundamentals of analytics
 * To advance an analytical competency within the group
 * To drive individual value for each participant

The motivations for these principles (in order), are the following:
 1. The analytics landscape is currently dominated by tools that make the application of analytics techniques far easier. Having a fundamental understanding of the principles behind the methods will allow a practitioner to transcend specific tooling and consider which technique to apply from the perspective of theory, instead of what is available and what others are doing.
 * There are many people who wish to work in the analytics space but are not afforded the opportunity to explore the foundations. The goal is to provide a deeper understanding of methods so that participants may feel confident in their application of those techniques or in their use.
 * The strength of our organisation lies in our people and their satisfaction in the workplace. This effort will provide an additional creative and technical outlet, but will also allow participants to receive external acknowledgement of the work done in this team (this will be achieved by publishing documents, code and applications from time to time).

### 3. Why is this important

 We are well positioned to provide expertise throughout the data lifecycle, including the analytics work that is often being done in-house. Unless this analytics capability is exercised, we stand to lose the people or the efficacy in servicing analytics requests.

### 4. Outcomes

  Participants will be able to expand on their existing analytics knowledge by interacting and sharing within the team.

### 5. How will this actually work

  There will be fortnightly meetups, for approximately two hours at a time. The format of this engagement will be that a seminal paper, or similar,  is read by all. Someone within the team will then present this paper at the next meeting and we will discuss it in detail. During the next fornightly cycle, we will set out to test statements/methods/techniques proposed in the paper by producing notebooks or any other output, which will be committed to GitHub.


### 6. The content

  The content will be primarly concerned with the domain of _prescriptive_ and _predictive_ analytics. The techniques that we will cover are:

    * Bagging and boosting
    * Random forests
    * Dimensionality reduction techniques
    * Kernel methods
    * Neural networks
    * Reinforcement learning
    * Transfer learning
    * Probabilistic graphical models
    * Information theory
    * Multi-objective optimisation
